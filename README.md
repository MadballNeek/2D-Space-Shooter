2D Space Shooter
======

A 2D space shooter created in Unity. This was originally based off of the excellent Unity tutorial by Walker Boys Studios (http://walkerboystudio.com/html/unity_course_lab_2.html), which I essentially used as a bootstrap project. Now, it's grown way beyond the initial intentions and structure. Please follow my progress on my blog (http://overdevelop.blogspot.com/).
